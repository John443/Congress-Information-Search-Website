# Congress-Information-Search-Website

This is a webpage that allows users to search for congress information using the Sunlight Congress API.

The webpage use bootstrap to show the stylesheet and AngularJS to controll data. I put the PHP file in the cloud server sirst, and let it issue request through AJAX to the server to grab the data of Congress.
